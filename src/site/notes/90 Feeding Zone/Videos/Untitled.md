In this video, you'll learn how to combine multiple sheets into a single Excel file. Many times, Excel files have sheets with inconsistent headers, extra junk rows or unnecessary sheets you want to remove.

We’ll use Power Query to merge all the sheets into one, making the process dynamic and automated. Once it's set up, you can simply refresh the file when new data comes in and everything will automatically combine into one place.
