Data analysis in Excel just got easier! Let me introduce you to the new Excel functions in Office 365: Excel GROUPBY and PIVOTBY functions. With these Excel functions you get to replace pivot tables with simple Excel formulas. In the video I cover the advantages of GROUPBY and PIVOTBY over pivot tables - for example the ability of GROUPBY to aggregate text values which pivot tables can't do. Also the ability to clean your data, for example remove total rows in the middle of your dataset or exclude certain rows with the Groupby and Pivotby functions. You also no longer need to refresh your data to get the latest result because formulas update automatically. 

‚¨áÔ∏è Grab the workbook I use in the video here: https://pages.xelplus.com/groupby-pivotby-function

In addition you'll learn about GROUPBY's optional arguments, like displaying headers, managing totals, and sorting data. A key highlight is its ability to process text values, offering unique text aggregations which is a notable advantage over Pivot Tables.

See GROUPBY in action as it tidies and analyzes complex data sets, easily filtering out unnecessary information for clearer reports. I also demonstrate how it efficiently groups sales data by year or month.

Finally, get to know PIVOTBY. This function is great for reducing vertical scrolling in reports, by shifting one or more of the categories to columns for a more concise and readable format.

Availability: GOUPBY & PIVOTY are currently available for Microsoft Insider Beta Channel only.
